# Appello React.js Boilerplate

This is the front-end boilerplate for all upcoming Appello projects, both React and React Native. It (will) contain all code styling agreements, instruments we should use, project structure, etc.  
Our aim is to standardize an approach to development so that it would be easier to create new projects and join existing ones.

## Code style

For code styling purposes we use ESLint with config based on Airbnb's one, and prettier.  
Husky runs both of them during a pre-commit phase, but you could also set up their running on save or whenever you want using your IDE.
